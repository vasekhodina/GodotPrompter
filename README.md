Agentic skills framework for Godot 4.x game development. Gives AI coding agents domain-specific expertise for GDScript and C# projects.

Inspired by and built on top of the [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) plugin for Claude Code — which provides the underlying skill loading, brainstorming, and workflow infrastructure that GodotPrompter extends with Godot-specific domain knowledge.

## What is this?

GodotPrompter is a plugin that provides **skills** — structured domain knowledge that AI agents load on demand. When you ask your agent to "add a state machine" or "set up multiplayer", it loads the relevant GodotPrompter skill and follows Godot-specific best practices instead of relying on generic knowledge.

**44 skills** covering project setup, architecture, gameplay systems, input handling, physics, 2D/3D systems, animation, shaders, audio, UI, multiplayer, localization, procedural generation, XR/VR, optimization, and C# patterns. All targeting Godot 4.3+ with both GDScript and C# examples — newer features from Godot 4.5 and 4.6 (variadic functions, abstract classes, stencil buffers, SoftBody3D forces, FoldableContainer, OpenXR Spatial Entities, and more) are included as annotated additive sections.

## Quick Start

### Claude Code (recommended)

```bash
# Add the marketplace
claude plugins marketplace add jame581/skillsmith

# Install the plugin
claude plugins install godot-prompter@skillsmith
```

Or install from a local clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jame581/GodotPrompter.git
claude plugins marketplace add ./GodotPrompter
claude plugins install godot-prompter@godot-prompter
```

Then start a new session and ask:

```
"I'm starting a new Godot 4.3 project. How should I organize it?"
```

The agent loads the `godot-project-setup` skill and provides a complete directory structure, autoload setup, and .gitignore — not generic advice.

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/jame581/GodotPrompter
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add jame581/skillsmith
copilot plugin install godot-prompter@skillsmith
```

### Cursor

```
/add-plugin godot-prompter
```

Or clone and place in your project — Cursor reads `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`.

### Codex

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jame581/GodotPrompter.git ~/.codex/godot-prompter
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
ln -s ~/.codex/godot-prompter/skills ~/.agents/skills/godot-prompter
```

See `.codex/INSTALL.md` for Windows instructions.

### OpenCode

Add to `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["godot-prompter@git+https://github.com/jame581/GodotPrompter.git"]
}
```

See `.opencode/INSTALL.md` for details.

## How It Works

### 1. Design Phase
Ask the agent to brainstorm a feature. It loads `godot-brainstorming` and walks you through:
- Clarifying questions about your game/system
- Architectural approaches with trade-offs
- Scene tree design, signal maps, and data flow
- An implementation plan with ordered tasks

### 2. Implementation Phase
For each task, the agent loads the relevant domain skill:
- Building a player? → `player-controller` + `input-handling` + `state-machine`
- Adding inventory? → `inventory-system` + `resource-pattern`
- Setting up 3D scene? → `3d-essentials` + `assets-pipeline`
- Adding particles? → `particles-vfx` + `shader-basics`
- Need animations? → `animation-system` + `tween-animation`
- Need save/load? → `save-load`

### 3. Review Phase
Ask for a code review. The agent loads `godot-code-review` and checks against Godot-specific checklists.

### Example Use Cases

- **"Set up a new Godot project"** — Loads the `godot-project-setup` skill and scaffolds a complete directory structure, autoloads, input map, and .gitignore following Godot best practices.
- **"Add a platformer player controller with coyote time and jump buffering"** — Loads `player-controller` and `input-handling` skills, providing complete CharacterBody2D code with physics-correct movement in both GDScript and C#.
- **"Design an enemy AI system with patrol, chase, and attack"** — Uses the `godot-game-architect` agent to plan the system with `ai-navigation`, `state-machine`, and `animation-system` skills, then the `godot-game-dev` agent to implement it.
- **"Set up a 3D scene with lighting, materials, and fog"** — Loads `3d-essentials` skill with StandardMaterial3D PBR workflow, DirectionalLight3D shadow configuration, environment setup, and volumetric fog.
- **"Add particle effects for explosions and fire"** — Loads `particles-vfx` skill with GPUParticles2D/3D recipes, ParticleProcessMaterial configuration, color ramps, and one-shot burst patterns.
- **"Review my code for Godot best practices"** — Uses the `godot-code-reviewer` agent with the `godot-code-review` skill to check node architecture, signal patterns, performance, input handling, and resource management.
